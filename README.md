Oscar is a Brood War bot designed to compile on Linux or Windows using BWAPI 4.2

Currently should compile with GCC and OpenBW on Linux (just run make). Also compiles on Windows as a standard dll bot.

Currently only supports Zerg and really doesn't even do anything besides follow build orders. Will submit to some ladders once it actually is attacking.
